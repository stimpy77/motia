# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Motia! We welcome contributions from the community to help make Motia better. Here are some ways you can contribute:

## Local Setup

Before contributing, you’ll need to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16+ recommended)
- **Python** (LTS recommended)
- **pnpm** (for managing the monorepo)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MotiaDev/motia.git
   cd motia
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
   
3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

4. Set up Motia in the playground:

   ```bash
   cd playground
   npx motia install
   ```

5. Set up environment variables:

   - Copy the example `.env` file:
     ```bash
     cp playground/.env.example playground/.env
     ```
   - Update the `.env` file with your credentials and API keys.

6. Start the development environment:

   - pnpn run dev

   - Run this command at the root of the project to start workbench

   ```bash
   pnpm dev:workbench
   ```

   This will start:

   - **MotiaCore** (flow orchestrator)
   - **MotiaServer** (HTTP endpoints)
   - **Playground UI** (flow visualization)

   The app runs locally at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.
